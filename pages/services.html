    <h4>Guided Tours</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>Are you an Activity Director, business owner, Scout Leader or part of any group of individuals looking for something 'different' to do close to home? We offer tours of our buildings year-round. Simply call ahead so that we can schedule a docent or two to guide your through the buildings and tell you all about Mechanicsburg's rich history.  Two weeks or more advance notice is appreciated.

Tours can last anywhere from forty-five minutes long (very brief, little history) to two hours or so (full descriptions and question-answer sessions). Of course, we recommend the full tour. When making reservations, we can provide you with a list of restaurants and motels in the area.

Groups larger than 20 may need to be split into smaller groups dues to limited space inside the buildings, but can usually be accommodated at the same time. There is no charge for a tour, but a small donation to the museum would be greatly appreciated. Please contact the Museum for additional information at (717) 697-6088, or e-mail us at mechanicsburgmuseum@verizon.net.  If leaving a message or sending an e-mail, please include your name, name of your organization, telephone number, size and age range of your group, and proposed date for a tour.

                      The Mechanicsburg Museum Association was founded in 1975 in a community effort to preserve the Stationmaster’s House, a historic Mechanicsburg landmark, from destruction. Since its founding, the Association has preserved and promoted Mechanicsburg’s unique history with educational programs, gallery exhibits, and by acquiring four more historic buildings in the area.
